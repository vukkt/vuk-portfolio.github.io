<h3>Discover My Work</h3>
<p>Currently employed at European Dynamics in the R&D department since December 2022, I've been contributing to various projects, including the development of a custom CMS named Sofia. This CMS has been pivotal in projects such as Tenacity, Resonance, BetterFactory, and CoProtect, each significant in its own right.</p>
